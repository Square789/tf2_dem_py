# tf2_dem_py
TF2 demo parser with python interfacing, written in C.

_(This project is under development, no built distribution packages as of yet.)_

### Installation instructions:
Can be built as a singular pyd extension module by running `setup.py build_ext -i`, however may need tweaking to suit your environment.

### Usage:
Nothing concrete yet; See the script `run.py`.

### Thanks:
 * The [demos.tf parser](https://www.github.com/demostf/parser), which this entire repo is is basically a C copy of.
 * The TF2 source code leak lmao
